# Module 20 Challenge

This is the repository for my module 20 challenge. In this module challenge, we built a smart contract that allows us to host joint savings accounts.  

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, we created a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses are able to control a joint savings account. 

My smart contract uses ether management functions to implement a financial institutionâ€™s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Technologies

This is the smart contract code in the Solidity file:

```python
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

contract JointSavings {
    address payable accountOne;
    address payable accountTwo;
    address public lastToWithdraw;
    uint public lastWithdrawAmount;
    uint public contractBalance;

    function withdraw(uint amount, address payable recipient) public {

        require(recipient == accountOne || recipient == accountTwo, "You don't own this account!");

        require(contractBalance >= amount, "Insufficient funds!");

        if (lastToWithdraw != recipient) {
            lastToWithdraw = recipient;
        }

        recipient.transfer(amount);
        lastWithdrawAmount = amount;
        contractBalance = address(this).balance;
    }

    function deposit() public payable {
        contractBalance = address(this).balance;
    }

    function setAccounts(address payable account1, address payable account2) public{
        accountOne = account1;
        accountTwo = account2;
    }

    function() external payable {}
}
```

## Examples

#### This first shows the Remix IDE after we define the addresses for the joint account.

![define addresses](./Execution_Results/define_addresses.png)


#### In this image, we see the total Ether smart contract balance (in wei) after depositing 16 ether into the smart contract.

![ether](./Execution_Results/deposit_5_ether.png)


#### Here we see a transaction where we withdraw 10 ether into account 2.

#### This final image shows a list of the transactions in the Remix IDE.
